## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

- Implemented `SizeOf` for `core::ffi::c_void`
- Implemented `SizeOf` for `std::fs::{DirEntry, File, FileType, Metadata, OpenOptions, Permissions}`
- Added support for the [`portable-simd`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86656) Rust feature,
  adds support for the `core::simd::Simd<T>` and `core::simd::Mask<T>` family of types (requires nightly compiler)
- Added support for the structs of `core::arch::{x86, x86_64, arm, aarch64, wasm, powerpc, powerpc64}`
  (`powerpc` and `powerpc64` require the `stdsimd` feature)
- Added the `stdsimd` feature flag which implements `SizeOf` for experimental simd types within `core::arch`
- Implemented `SizeOf` for `core::num::FpCategory`

## [0.1.5] - 2023-02-23

## Added

- Implemented `SizeOf` for `std::net::{IpAddr, Ipv4Addr, Ipv6Addr, SocketAddr, SocketAddrV4, SocketAddrV6}`
- Added support for the [`bigdecimal`](https://crates.io/crates/bigdecimal) crate under the `bigdecimal` feature
- Added support for the [`num-bigint`](https://crates.io/crates/num-bigint) crate under the `num-bigint` feature

## [0.1.4] - 2022-11-04

## Added

- Implemented `SizeOf` for `core::any::TypeId`

## Changed

  (were previously dependent on the `derive` feature)
- `derive(SizeOf)` now partially normalizes types and doesn't emit bounds for `fn` types

## [0.1.3] - 2022-10-21

## Added

- Support for the [`xxhash-rust`](https://docs.rs/xxhash-rust) crate with the `xxhash-xxh32`, `xxhash-xxh64`
